        If your here... most likely its because an alter in my system posted it because it was asked about. In short:
        i have dissociative identity disorder. so the reason i put something like "(b)" is to let everyone know which one 
        of my personalities or alters is out. if you have a problem with it, please dm me on discord on the account KenzCo#2620, 
        if you want more information on it, click the link below. Also linked below is some information on my alts.

        D.I.D. is where one "person" or body in this case has multiple people inside it. it can be incredibly stressful
        so please excuse any miss spellings that may occur by me, or any of my alters. Most times it occurs when a person
        has one or more traumatic experiences in their childhood. It can occur without one, but its incredibly rare. An 
        alter can be human, or can be a type of Introject. Introjects are the minds internal representation of whatever 
        that thing is. They arise because their source was present at the time of trauma, usually as a coping mechanism. 
        So The original core person of the system might have been playing Pok√©mon when someone caused them trauma, etc. 
        There are two categories of 
    <ul>
        <li>There are Fictives, based on characters or fictional people/creatures (like Zelda from LoZ, Iron Man from any source, Gandalf from LotR, James Bond, etc. Please note that each fictive can be different and remember things about their source of varying degrees)</li>
    
        <li>There are Factives, based on real life people. Again, each one is different and unique due to potentially having different sources and different memories, etc. (Examples include youtubers [Jaiden Animations, the Game Theorists, etc], famous people or singers or actors, famous sports players, the systems best friend, etc.)</li>
    
        <li>There are also many types of non-human headmates (alternate states of identity/people) can be any species, fictional or real by normal human standards, as they are internal representations and sometimes manifest or relate to the trauma or situation that formed them or their role in the system.</li>
    </ul>
