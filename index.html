<p>Dissociative identity disorder(a.k.a. DID) is a mental disorder where a single mind can contain 
more than one personality. Many people who have DID expirence memory gaps where a different alter 
fronted. an alter is what a plural person calls their personalities. often plural people have other 
conditions like depression, post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), OCD, and sleep disorders. although 
personally we only have depression, maybe some OCD.... </p>

<p>DID is associated with overwhelming traumas, or abuse during childhood. in fact, about 90% of cases 
have a histoy of childhood abuse </p>
